# Introduction

This plugin provides an independent authentication integration capability for global cluster failure scenarios. If the global cluster fails, users can still log in through this service to access and operate the Kubernetes cluster, while keeping permissions consistent with the state before the global cluster failure (group permissions are not supported).

To ensure the plugin continues to work during a global cluster failure, ACP is recommended to use a third-party image registry.
