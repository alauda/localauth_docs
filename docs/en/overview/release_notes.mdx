# Release Notes

## Minor Version: 1.0.0

### Features and Enhancements

#### First Release

- **Independent cluster authentication service**
  - Provides an independent authentication integration capability for global cluster failure scenarios
  - Ensures users can still log in to access and operate Kubernetes clusters when the global cluster is unavailable
  - Keeps user permissions consistent with the state before the global cluster failure (group permissions not supported)

- **Support for multiple identity providers (IDP)**
  - **LDAP**: Supports integration with LDAP/Active Directory, including configurable user search and attribute mapping
  - **OIDC**: Supports integration with OIDC identity providers, including scopes and claim mapping (email, username, groups)
  - Uses `Connector` Custom Resources (CRs) in the `cpaas-system` namespace to manage IDP configurations

- **AC CLI integration**
  - Supports authentication and login to workload clusters via AC CLI (version >= 1.1)
  - Provides CLI parameters for choosing IDP (`--idp`), authentication type (`--auth-type ldap|oidc`), and workload cluster login (`--workload`)

- **ACP integration and deployment**
  - Delivered as an Alauda Container Platform Cluster Authentication plugin package
  - Supports installation via ACP web console and CLI
  - Uses `ModuleInfo` resources to install the plugin to target clusters (with `.spec.version` set to `v1.0.0`)

### Known Limitations

- Group permissions are not supported; only user-level permissions are maintained after global cluster failure.
